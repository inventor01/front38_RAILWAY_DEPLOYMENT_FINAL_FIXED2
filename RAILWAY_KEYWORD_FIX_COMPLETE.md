# Front 39 - Railway Keyword Detection - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issue Resolved: Discord /list_keywords Command Now Shows Correct Keywords

### **Problem Identified:**
- Token monitor was detecting tokens but not matching keywords properly
- Discord bot `/list_keywords` command was looking at wrong database
- System was using local Neon database instead of Railway production database

### **Solution Applied:**

**1. Database Connection Fixed:**
- Token Monitor: Now uses Railway database URL
- Discord Bot: Hardcoded to use Railway database 
- All 27 Discord slash commands now use correct database

**2. Keywords Verified in Railway Database:**
```
‚úÖ Railway Database Contains 18 Active Keywords:
‚Ä¢ coin          ‚Ä¢ wasp          ‚Ä¢ radioactive
‚Ä¢ nuclear       ‚Ä¢ doll          ‚Ä¢ Kai labubu
‚Ä¢ The big leagues  ‚Ä¢ You're #1   ‚Ä¢ you made it
‚Ä¢ peak          ‚Ä¢ cliff         ‚Ä¢ grok
‚Ä¢ less          ‚Ä¢ milk          ‚Ä¢ The big leauges
‚Ä¢ Ig maps       ‚Ä¢ instagram maps ‚Ä¢ Septum theory
```

**3. System Status:**
- **Keyword Loading**: ‚úÖ "üîÑ Refreshed 18 keywords for 1 users"
- **Token Matching**: ‚úÖ Successfully matched "coin" in "Just Crime Coin" and "dog coin"
- **Discord Bot**: ‚úÖ All 27 slash commands connected to Railway database

### **Test Results:**

**Token Detection Working:**
